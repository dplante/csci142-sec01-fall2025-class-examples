In your ClassExamples repository, you'll see a project called LinkedListLab.  Use 
the two classes there to learn more about Linked Lists and some of the subtle issues
concerning Nodes versus the data Nodes store. For this lab, as usual, create a repository
and copy the two classes to a package called "structures" in the project. You should also create 
a package called "testcases" in the project where you will place your test cases. You are
to implement the remaining methods that are stubbed out in the LinkedList class but
not implemented in the included code. You are to test the class as a user would by
developing a set of test cases for the LinkedList class and move the Node class INTO
the LinkedList class (making Node a private class). We discussed this in class, but if
you still are unsure, you should think about these questions: Why move the Node class
into LinkedList? Why make it private? Again, we have discussed this in class, but make
sure you really understand it. Also, you must make Objects generic and
parameterizable. (e.g. <E> or <T>) (Hint: you will need both <E> and <T> since you are
making your Node class a private class within the LinkedList class.) As already noted,
place your classes in two packages: structures and testcases. You must have test
cases for every method you must complete. The finished lab is due, with a solid set of
test cases using JUnit (you should have about 50 test cases), by Wednesday,
November 16th at midnight.

NOTE: This lab is much more straightforward than the Connect 4 MVC project, but
you still must start early to get it done well. In the end, you will only have one class in
the structures package and one or more test classes in your testcases package,
depending on how you wish to write your test cases. There will definitely not be an
extension for this lab, so please work on it soon! :) Good luck with it!
